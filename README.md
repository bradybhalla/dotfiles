# dotfiles

A few of my more important dotfiles. Meant for use with zsh. If not using homebrew to install command line tools, some paths in .zshrc may need to be changed.

## Usage
```bash
chmod +x configure.sh
./configure.sh
```
This script will back up existing files and copy everything in this repository to the correct location in the home directory.
